## Approach

The use of a combined catch and observation table allows for a single
source table to be used in discard estimation. Previous methods took a
two table approach, where catch information and observer records were
stratified independently, and then matched to calculate discard (e.g.,
![D = K\*d/k](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;D%20%3D%20K%2Ad%2Fk "D = K*d/k")).
This approach had the possibility of mismatches between observed strata
and trip strata. In reality, this cannot occur. We therefore do trip by
trip matching, using `gear`, `meshgroup`, `statistical area`, and
`LINK1`, to match observer recorded species discards with commercial
trip activity.

The primary driver for this approach was to use the trip recorded
metrics as the stratification source. This reduces the possibility of
mismatches and removes much of the hard-coding of the past. Upfront
matching also allows observed discards to easily be used as the official
discard for a particular trip. Furthermore, we recognize that data
errors either from the catch, or observer data, will result in a
non-match. This likely reduces the total pool of observed trips that are
being used, but we feel the benefits of using this apporach outweigh a
reduced sample size. Quality control of these data are outside the
purview of the CAMS project. Last, we only use observed trips (`LINK1`)
where valid `LINK3` (hauls) occurred to alleviate issues of multiple
`LINK1` records for a single subtrip.

The matching occurs in a staged manner. All commercial trips with a
non-null `LINK1` field get a value for how many unique VTR serial
numbers are associated with it. The vast majority of observed trips have
a single VTR, and only require matching by `LINK1`. For multiple VTR
trips, a match as described above is used (`gear`, `meshgroup`,
`statistical area`, and `LINK1`). Further, we only match on
`statistical area` when more than one area is reported for a trip. This
reduces data loss from observer recorded area mismatches to VTR recorded
area.

`meshgroup` has been defined several ways depending on the data stream.
CAMS initiated a subgroup which determined the most pragmatic definition
for `meshgroup` based on clustering of recorded mesh sizes in both
observer and cacth records.

All nets:

-   `small` : \< 3.99 (inches) <!-- - `medium` :  4-5.74 (inches) -->
-   `large` : \>= 4.00 (inches)

Gill Nets:

-   `extra large` \>= 8 (inches)

`gear` groupings for matching purposes required a mapping of NEGEAR
codes from observed and commercial trips to VTR three-character gear
codes (e.g.Â `DRS`, `PTO`, etc). The relationship in our database tables
(VLGEAR, FVTR_GEAR) are many-to-many and do not map easily. Furthermore,
there are several NEGEAR codes in VTR that do not occur in observer
records, and vice versa. Therefore, a support table,
`MAPS.CFG_OBS_VTR_GEARMAP` was constructed to facilitate gear matching.

IMPORTANT!: The `CAMS_OBS_CATCH` table is a hybrid. For trips that were
not observed, there will be a single row, with all trip metrics, and a
total `KALL` per subtrip. When a trip was observed, there are multiple
rows, where the trip metric information is repeated and each row shows
species, discarded amount, and other observer recorded information for
each row. Total `KALL` **CANNOT** be calculated without filtering rows
by `LINK1` to indicate an observed trip or not. These steps are outlined
in subsequent R modules used to run `discaRd`.
